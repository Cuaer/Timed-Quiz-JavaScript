# Timed Quiz - JavaScript

## The Assignment
Using JavaScript, students were tasked to create a Quiz application. Armed with the knowledge of web APIs, students had to use events and localStorage to save user quiz results and display them as a score.

Upon opening the application, the user will be greeted with a landing page and a 'Start' button with some instructions.

Once the start button has been clicked, a box with questions and a timer will display along with the first question and multiple choice options.

After the user clicks their response to the first question, they will be given points if correct or have time deducted from their timer by 5 seconds until the correct answer is chosen.

After finishing the quiz or running out of time, the user will be greeted with an alert window stating 'Game Over' given a score based on the time remaining. The user will then be able to type their initials and click the 'Submit' button to save their score with their initials. The following screen will display a screen with the list of previous scores.

## The Results
The final application displays a working start button and displays the initial set of answers with the respective question but struggles to display the timer and does not proceed to the next questions.
